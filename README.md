**NexGen: Crafting Your Vision into Brand Brilliance**

## Challenge

NexGen aims to address the lack of accessible and comprehensive marketing services for individuals and small businesses looking to establish a strong brand presence. Many entrepreneurs and small businesses struggle to find affordable and reliable resources for logo design, cohesive brand identity creation, and professional website development. NexGen provides these services, helping clients compete more effectively in the market.

However, NexGen is not intended for large-scale marketing campaigns or enterprise-level branding needs. While it offers valuable services for individuals and small to medium-sized businesses, it may not meet the requirements of larger corporations with complex branding and marketing demands.

## Project Updates

Changed some of the designs to make them more professional but not core things in the project deliverables.

## Progress

**Progress Rating:** This week, I'd rate my progress at a 7 out of 10.  
**Measuring Progress:** I use a Trello board to track my accomplishments. Each completed task on the board signifies a step forward.

### Rationale for Rating

**Achievements:**

- **Landing Page Completion:** Successfully built the landing page, a critical element of the website's initial presentation.
- **Frontend Progress:** Made substantial progress on the website's frontend development, focusing on the most crucial aspects.
- **Flask Configuration (Ongoing):** Began configuring the Flask backend, which is essential for website functionality.

**Areas for Improvement:**

- Incomplete backend configuration: The Flask configuration remains unfinished and requires further attention.

### Project Completion Timeline

While I'm confident of meeting the initial deadline outlined in the Project Proposal and MVP definition, incorporating additional features learned throughout development (APIs and databases) may require adjustments. I'll provide a more precise timeline update after assessing the scope of these additional features.

## Technical Challenges

### Framework Adoption

Integrating a framework like Bootstrap to elevate the website's functionality and aesthetics involved a learning curve but significantly enhanced web development capabilities.

### Server-Side Exploration

The project highlighted the importance of server-side configuration. While I'm still exploring this area, I recognize its significance for future projects.

### Design Considerations

The website's design scope expanded beyond initial expectations. Collaborating with a friend helped bridge this gap by creating the logo.
